                Getting lash strips off has always been a hard one at least for
                some of us. But Orbe has made it easier through a centrally
                raised innovative box. With the support of glue-less pull tabs,
                you can take strips off the box more easily. No more tedious
                effort, and coming in contact with the 'clunky' side walls
                during a careful extraction. We always believe in working
                smarter, not harder!

                Just as life, sometimes a lash artist's trolley can look like a
                mess. No one to blame. Most, if not all, standard lash packaging
                is not organisation-friendly. Orbe lashes, however, come with a
                colour coded system. Allowing you huns to group together similar
                lashes by type. As an example, when searching for pre-mades you
                can easily navigate through the green colour. You'll save time,
                and look as if got things in order in front of clients!

                Lashing is a tricky business! Isn't it? So detailed! So much to
                remember! What if you didn't have to remember so much? Such as
                information on the lash strips. Orbe lash strips contain five
                important details (more than any other brand offers) including
                Curl, Length, Thickness, Profile (round or flat) and lash type
                (color coded). Now, there is no need to remember which lashes
                you're working with, less chance of making errors, more space in
                your head and a prettier lash palette!

                Standard industry boxes have 12 rows, but Orbe lashes have 16
                rows with 4cm wide strip. This allows us to provide on average
                25% more lashes per box compared to industry average.

              <p>
                Many lash artists say that inaccurate lash sizes are a common
                industry issue. Orbe has strict quality checks in place to
                ensure 99% of the time our lash sizes are accurate. Afterall,
                the Orbe symbol is a sign of precision.

              <p>
                Curl retention is one key indicator of lash quality. We tested
                Orbe lashes on average retained curl for over a year. If your
                unused lashes lose curl within a year, we will happily refund or
                replace them.

              <p>
                Low residue during lash extraction from strip presents a cleaner surface for bonding. Orbe manufacturing uses a special technique to add lashes so they come off easily without glue residue
